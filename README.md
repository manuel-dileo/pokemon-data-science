# Pokémon Data Science

Exploratory analysis and application of machine learning algorithms on a pokemon dataset.

## Dataset
The Complete Pokemon Dataset has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon/home). 
To get all the information on it I suggest you visit the page linked above.

### Changes

- The capture rate of Minior varies depending on the form in which it is when we try to capture it. To facilitate the operations on this character, I set the capture rate of Minior in its core form.

## Exploratory analysis

Below you will find the list of the main research questions(constantly updating).
- Which no-legendary pokémon is the most diffucult to catch ?
- For every basic stat. , Which pokémon has the highest value? Which pokémon has the lowest value ?
- How many species of pokémon exist for each type ? Which type is the most common ?
- Which ability is the most common ?

Please see exploration.ipynb notebook.

## Machine Learning

- We build a classifier to identify legendary pokémon (legendary_classifier.ipynb).
